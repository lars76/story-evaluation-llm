# Story Evaluation Dataset

![model_rankings_comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bff2bf8d-48b4-4ed5-b3ae-fe60a5f8d21a)

This dataset contains stories generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages, with comprehensive quality evaluations. It was created to train and benchmark models specifically on creative writing tasks.

This benchmark evaluates an LLM's ability to generate high-quality short stories based on simple prompts like "write a story about X with n words." It is similar to TinyStories but targets longer-form and more complex content, focusing on narrative structure, character development, and prose quality.

The complete dataset can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lars1234/story_writing_benchmark).

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files:

- `average.csv`: Contains all generated stories with evaluation metrics averaged across all evaluator models. **This is the primary dataset file for most users.**
- `aya_expanse.csv`: Stories evaluated using Aya Expanse 32B
- `gemma2.csv`: Stories evaluated using Gemma 2 9B (SPPO-Iter3)
- `llama.csv`: Stories evaluated using Llama 3.3 70B
- `mistral.csv`: Stories evaluated using Mistral Small 24B (2501)

## Columns Description

### Story Generation Columns

- `prompt_id`: Unique identifier for each prompt
- `prompt`: The actual text prompt given to the model
- `story_text`: The generated story text
- `target_word_count`: The requested word count for the story (for scene-based stories, this is split between beginning/continuation)
- `language`: Language of the story (en, de, es)
- `theme`: The theme of the story (e.g., adventure, horror, romance)
- `time_period`: The time period setting (e.g., medieval times, distant future)
- `generation_type`: Type of generation (complete, scene_beginning, scene_continuation)
- `model_name`: Name of the model that generated the story
- `temperature`: Temperature setting used for generation
- `seed`: Random seed used for generation

### Evaluation Columns

- `length_score`: Score based on how closely the story matched the target word count
- `overall_score`: The average score across all evaluation criteria
- `q1` to `q15`: Individual quality metrics (detailed below)
- `q_translation`: For non-English stories, whether the text reads naturally

#### Quality Metrics (q1-q15)

1. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation quality
2. Clarity and understandability
3. Logical connection between events and ideas
4. Scene construction and purpose
5. Internal consistency within the story's context
6. Character consistency
7. Character motivation and actions making sense
8. Sentence pattern variety
9. Avoidance of clich√©s and overused phrases
10. Natural dialogue
11. Avoidance of predictable narrative tropes
12. Character depth and dimensionality
13. Realistic character interactions
14. Ability to hold reader interest
15. Satisfying plot resolution

Individual evaluator files also include `w1` through `w5`: Five identified weaknesses in the story, ranked by significance.

## Dataset Statistics

- **15 LLM models**: Each generating stories with the same set of parameters
- **568 stories per model**: Each model generated exactly 568 stories
- **8,520 total stories**: Across all models
- **Story types**: 
  - Complete stories (~1000-2000 words)
  - Two-part stories (beginning/continuation, ~500-1000 words each)
- **Languages**: English, German, and Spanish
- **Generation parameters**:
  - 4 temperature settings (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25)
  - 2 random seeds (42, 48)
  - min_p of 0.05

## Story Matching for Comparison and Training

There are 1,310 unique prompts in total, with some overlap between models. For researchers looking to use this dataset for training or evaluation, stories can be matched for comparison (e.g., for DPO training) in several ways:

1. **Exact prompt matches**: Stories with identical `prompt_id` values were generated from the exact same prompt
2. **Thematic matches**: Stories can be matched by `language`, `theme`, and `time_period`
3. **Generation type matches**: Match `complete` stories with other `complete` stories, or match corresponding scene pairs
4. **Quality-based sorting**: Use `overall_score` to create preferred/rejected pairs regardless of prompts
